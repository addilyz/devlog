it took me four prototypes and a whole week but today i got my collision code working against static solids in one go. so that's wonderful, isn't it? this week has been painful. see you next week i'm sorry i don't really have much more to say. it's three-point collision that pairs over body tables idk what else to say. thank you, God, for releasing me from my torment at this late hour so i at least had something good to say on the blog.

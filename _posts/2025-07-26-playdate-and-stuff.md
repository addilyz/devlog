alright, back again, this week i redid multiple systems so that i could have basic functionality with parity between the playdate console and love2d! i'm now developing on the playdate console as well. i got a textbox working really well in the new setup but i haven't ported over a map viewer or editor yet and i can't really show much currently, but there is really good news. within the next two or three weeks i should be able to build my first prototype of the very beginning section of the game i'm going to be working on, and that will just be playable for all you folks at home. so please pardon me for skipping on a media attachment this week i'm just in a hurry to get the blog done. might end up attaching media later anyways who knows. see you next week!

this is where i will be keeping a record of my antics throughout the week!
my arms hurt. but i will keep typing because i have a problem! this week i managed to recover multiple libraries from months ago! i also migrated my working repos to codeberg to avoid ai, blegh! i wrote a new table-to-file script i called filer earlier today as well! and i have started working on a new directory tool and i put etch on codeberg so the thing i'm working on the most currently is finally tracked somewhere! see you next week! hope you're entertained! i'll try to take a break tomorrow.
